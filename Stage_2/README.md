## Classification stage

In `src` we present the notebook with data loading and model training routine. We also show performance on validation set.

In `data` we provide the stage 2 sequences images for Tank-treading and Flipping cells (output from stage 1 - cleaning).

Moreover we provide in `pretrained` a pretrained model that can be used directly to classify Tank-treading and Flipping cell sequences.
